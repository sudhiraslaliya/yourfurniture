First of all,
You have to install this  dotnet SDK - https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/sdk-8.0.303-windows-x64-installer

Then open vs code and go to new terminal 

then , if you do not have downloaded and installed dotnet through the terminal or SDk file.

Then Change the directory to the project file, and open new terminal 

write - dotnet build , then write dotnet run command.

after no getting error project will start on localhost.
